    "Belgium is known all over the world for making unbeatable chocolates. It is paradise for the chocolate lovers. The country has a long and illustrious history of chocolate making. With around 2,000 chocolate companies and shops all over Belgium, the country remains one of the reigning producers and exporters of chocolate in the world. Based on available figures, Belgium exports more than 400,000 tons of chocolate with an annual turnover of over 4 billion euros.  \n",
    "Behind every top chocolate brand, stands a team of top chocolatiers. They use their knowledge, experience and craftsmanship to create the most finest and sophisticated pralines, using the best products: high quality Belgian chocolate. They don’t shy away from the latest innovation and technological developments in the chocolate sector. And that makes them award-winning in several international competitions like the Patisserie World Cup."

    "A successful Belgian  chocolatier is going to expand his business into the United States.  Los Angeles is decided to be the starting point to open a new Belgian coffee shop combined with chokolate shop. Since  Los Angeles is so big and has lots of different coffee shops and chcolate chops developed by famous brands, my client needs deeper insight from available data in oder to decide where to establish his first Belgian coffee shop in the US. Another problem is that LA has very high lease rents for retail property.  \n",
    "To solve this business problem, we are going to cluster LA neighborhoods in order to recommend venues and the current average rent of lease in order business owner could make a decision to start a coffee shop. For this purpose we will try to find the optimal solution in terms of competitive location, comfortable lease rents, as well as surrounding venues."

    "Let's discuss the above mentioned problem statements. First of all we know that our client, famous Belgian chocolatier, wants to lease a retaile place for his unnique coffee shop combined with chocolate shop. Also he needs to find out the level of competition - how many coffee shops and restaurants are there in different neighborhoods. If there are more than 2-5 coffee shops and restaurants in a neighborhood then that would be a great risk to open new coffee shops in that neighborhood. Selecting a place where there is less or no coffee shops / restaurants would be of great choice, considering the lease rent of neighborhood too. Places like Downtown, Movie theatre, Parks, Malls & Gas stations would help his business running."
